## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Reference

### Products Collection
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  price: Number,
  category: String,
  image: String, // URL or path
  stock: Number,
  featured: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### Categories Collection (Optional - Not Used in 2-Hour Version)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  name: String,
  description: String,
  slug: String
}
```

**Note**: For the 2-hour hackathon, we're only implementing the Products collection. Orders will not be persisted to the database - checkout will be UI only.

## üìù Notes for 2-Hour Hackathon

- **Images**: Use placeholder images or AI-generated images with the prompts provided
- **Database**: Only products stored in MongoDB; orders are UI-only
- **Checkout**: Shows order summary but doesn't process/save orders
- **Authentication**: Not required - simplified for hackathon
- **Security**: Not a focus - keep it simple
- **Testing**: Manual testing only, no automated tests
- **Focus**: Prioritize working features over perfect code

## üéØ Ready to Start?

Once this PRD is approved, we'll begin with **Phase 1: Project Setup & Database**. Each phase must be completed and validated before moving to the next phase.

**Remember**: This is a 2-hour sprint! Stay focused on core functionality, use the time estimates as guidance, and don't get stuck on perfection. The goal is a working demo that showcases your futuristic e-commerce concept.

Good luck with your hackathon! üöÄ‚ö°
